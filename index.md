### About
This library is featuring the spatial discretization method of Isogeometric Analysis, which is considered an extension of the Finite Element method based on the shape functions provided by Computer Aided Design. In its core, it serves as an implementation of the Discretization project of the [MSolve.Core](https://github.com/mgroupntua/MSolve.Core) repo.
